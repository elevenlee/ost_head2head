ost_head2head
=============

For this assignment, we'll be creating a new command called head2head that can be used to compare objects one pair at a time until a ranking between all objects is obtained using the Condorcet method.  The idea is similar to what you might see on websites like http://www.greatmovieexperiment.com/.
